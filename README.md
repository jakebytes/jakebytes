## Hey - my name's Jake  

I'm a *multimedia* artist that's learning how to code!  

Some of my **favorite** things are:
- cooking delicious meals 🍝 
- going for a hike 🥾
- playing with my cat 😹
- collecting film cameras 📸

This summer I'm interning as a web developer, for a website that helps STEM students find jobs :-)
