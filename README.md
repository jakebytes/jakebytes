## Hey - my name's Jake  

I'm a *multimedia artist* that's learning how to code.  
This summer I'm interning as a **web developer**, for a website that helps STEM students find jobs!

Some of my favorite things are:
- drinking *good* coffee ☕
- cooking delicious meals 🍝
- going for a hike 🥾 
- playing with my cat 😹
